:::note
If you're working with LLMs for summarization, this tutorial is for you. While we'll specifically focus on evaluating a meeting summarizer, the concepts and practices here can be applied to **any LLM application tasked with summary generation**.
:::

## Get Started

DeepEval is an open-source LLM evaluation framework that supports a wide-range of metrics to help evaluate and iterate on your LLM applications.

## What You Will Evaluate

In this tutorial you will build and evaluate a **meeting summarization agent** that is used by famous tools like **Otter.ai** and **Circleback** to generate their summaries and action items from meeting transcripts. You will use `deepeval` and evalue the summarization agent's ability to generate:

- A concise summary of the discussion
- A clear list of action items

Below is an example of what a deliverable from a meeting summarization platform might look like:

In the next section, we'll build this summarization agent from scratch using OpenAI API.

:::tip
If you already have an LLM agent to evaluate, you can skip to [Evaluation Section](tutorial-summarization-evaluation) of this tutorial.
