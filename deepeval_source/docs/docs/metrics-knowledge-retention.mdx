The knowledge retention metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot is able to retain factual information presented **throughout a conversation**.

:::info
This is great for a LLM powered questionnaire use case.

## Required Arguments

To use the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating a [`ConversationalTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-multiturn-test-cases):

- `turns`

You must provide the `role` and `content` for evaluation to happen. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

## Usage

The `KnowledgeRetentionMetric()` can be used for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) multi-turn evaluation:

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import Turn, ConversationalTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import KnowledgeRetentionMetric

convo_test_case = ConversationalTestCase(
    turns=[Turn(role="...", content="..."), Turn(role="...", content="...")]
)
metric = KnowledgeRetentionMetric(threshold=0.5)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(convo_test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[convo_test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

There are **FIVE** optional parameters when creating a `KnowledgeRetentionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the maximum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 0. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### As a standalone

You can also run the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` on a single test case as a standalone, one-off execution.

```python
...

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score, metric.reason)
```

:::caution
This is great for debugging or if you wish to build your own evaluation pipeline, but you will **NOT** get the benefits (testing reports, Confident AI platform) and all the optimizations (speed, caching, computation) the `evaluate()` function or `deepeval test run` offers.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Knowledge Retention} = \frac{\text{Number of Assistant Turns without Knowledge Attritions}}{\text{Total Number of Assistant Turns}}" />

The `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` first uses an LLM to extract knowledge supplied in `"content"` by the `"user"` role throughout `turns`, before using the same LLM to determine whether each corresponding `"assistant"` content indicates an inability to recall said knowledge.
