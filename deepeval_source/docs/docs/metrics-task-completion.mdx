The task completion metric uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate how effectively an **LLM agent accomplishes a task**. Task Completion is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

:::info
Task Completion analyzes your **agent's full trace** to determine task success, which requires [setting up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing).
:::

## Usage

To begin, [set up tracing](/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing) and simply supply the `TaskCompletionMetric()` to your agent's `@observe` tag.

```python
from deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletionMetric
from deepeval.tracing import observe
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval import evaluate

task_completion = TaskCompletionMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4o",
    include_reason=True
)

@observe(metrics=[task_completion])
def trip_planner_agent(input):
    destination = "Paris"
    days = 2

    @observe()
    def restaurant_finder(city):
        return ["Le Jules Verne", "Angelina Paris", "Septime"]

    @observe()
    def itinerary_generator(destination, days):
        return ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum", "Montmartre"][:days]

    itinerary = itinerary_generator(destination, days)
    restaurants = restaurant_finder(destination)

    output = []
    for i in range(days):
        output.append(f"{itinerary[i]} and eat at {restaurants[i]}")

    return ". ".join(output) + "."

evaluate(observed_callback=trip_planner_agent, goldens=[Golden(input="Paris, 2")])
```

There are **SEVEN** optional parameters when creating a `TaskCompletionMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `task`: a string representing the task to be completed. If no task is supplied, it is automatically inferred from the trace. Defaulted to the `None`
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `strict_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enforces a binary metric score: 1 for perfection, 0 otherwise. It also overrides the current threshold and sets it to 1. Defaulted to `False`.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-a-metric-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

### End-to-End

You can also run the `TaskCompletionMetric` for [end-to-end](/docs/evaluation-end-to-end-llm-evals) evaluation as a standalone, though this is not the recommended way to use it, since the full trace is required for thorough evaluation.

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.metrics import TaskCompletionMetric
from deepeval.test_case import ToolCall

metric = TaskCompletionMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4.1",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="Plan a 3-day itinerary for Paris with cultural landmarks and local cuisine.",
    actual_output=(
        "Day 1: Eiffel Tower, dinner at Le Jules Verne. "
        "Day 2: Louvre Museum, lunch at Angelina Paris. "
        "Day 3: Montmartre, evening at a wine bar."
    ),
    tools_called=[
        ToolCall(
            name="Itinerary Generator",
            description="Creates travel plans based on destination and duration.",
            input_parameters={"destination": "Paris", "days": 3},
            output=[
                "Day 1: Eiffel Tower, Le Jules Verne.",
                "Day 2: Louvre Museum, Angelina Paris.",
                "Day 3: Montmartre, wine bar.",
            ],
        ),
        ToolCall(
            name="Restaurant Finder",
            description="Finds top restaurants in a city.",
            input_parameters={"city": "Paris"},
            output=["Le Jules Verne", "Angelina Paris", "local wine bars"],
        ),
    ],
)

# To run metric as a standalone
# metric.measure(test_case)
# print(metric.score, metric.reason)

evaluate(test_cases=[test_case], metrics=[metric])
```

To use the `TaskCompletionMetric` for end-to-end evaluation, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`LLMTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-test-cases#llm-test-case):

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `tools_called`

The `input` and `actual_output` are required to create an `LLMTestCase` (and hence required by all metrics) even though they might not be used for metric calculation. Read the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section below to learn more.

:::caution
This is not recommended and will be deprecated soon as a test case does not represent the full execution of an agent.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `TaskCompletionMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Task Completion Score} = \text{AlignmentScore}(\text{Task}, \text{Outcome})" />

- **Task** and **Outcome** are extracted from the trace (or test case for end-to-end) using an LLM.
- The **Alignment Score** measures how well the outcome aligns with the extracted (or user-provided) task, as judged by an LLM.
