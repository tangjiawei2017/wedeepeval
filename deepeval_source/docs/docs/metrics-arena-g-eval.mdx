<MetricTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} custom={true} />

The arena G-Eval is an adopted version of `deepeval`'s popular [`GEval` metric](/docs/metrics-llm-evals) but for choosing which `LLMTestCase` performed better instead.

:::info
To ensure non-bias, `ArenaGEval` utilizes a blinded, randomized positioned, n-pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge approach to pick the best performing iteration of your LLM app by representing them as "contestants".
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `ArenaGEval` metric, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an [`ArenaTestCase`](/docs/evaluation-arena-test-cases):

- `contestants`

You'll also need to supply any additional arguments such as `expected_output` and `context` within the `LLMTestCase` of `contestants` if your evaluation criteria depends on these parameters.

## Usage

To create a custom metric that chooses the best `LLMTestCase`, simply instantiate a `ArenaGEval` class and define an evaluation criteria in everyday language:

```python
from deepeval.test_case import ArenaTestCase, LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
from deepeval.metrics import ArenaGEval

a_test_case = ArenaTestCase(
    contestants={
        "GPT-4": LLMTestCase(
            input="What is the capital of France?",
            actual_output="Paris",
        ),
        "Claude-4": LLMTestCase(
            input="What is the capital of France?",
            actual_output="Paris is the capital of France.",
        ),
    },
)
metric = ArenaGEval(
    name="Friendly",
    criteria="Choose the winner of the more friendly contestant based on the input and actual output",
    evaluation_params=[
        LLMTestCaseParams.INPUT,
        LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT,
    ],
)


metric.measure(a_test_case)
print(metric.winner, metric.reason)
```

There are **THREE** mandatory and **FOUR** optional parameters required when instantiating an `ArenaGEval` class:

- `name`: name of metric. This will **not** affect the evaluation.
- `criteria`: a description outlining the specific evaluation aspects for each test case.
- `evaluation_params`: a list of type `LLMTestCaseParams`, include only the parameters that are relevant for evaluation..
- [Optional] `evaluation_steps`: a list of strings outlining the exact steps the LLM should take for evaluation. If `evaluation_steps` is not provided, `ConversationalGEval` will generate a series of `evaluation_steps` on your behalf based on the provided `criteria`. You can only provide either `evaluation_steps` **OR** `criteria`, and not both.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4.1'.
- [Optional] `async_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, enables [concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.](/docs/metrics-introduction#measuring-metrics-in-async) Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `verbose_mode`: a boolean which when set to `True`, prints the intermediate steps used to calculate said metric to the console, as outlined in the [How Is It Calculated](#how-is-it-calculated) section. Defaulted to `False`.

:::danger
For accurate and valid results, only evaluation parameters that are mentioned in `criteria`/`evaluation_steps` should be included as a member of `evaluation_params`.
:::

## How Is It Calculated?

The `ArenaGEval` is an adapted version of [`GEval`](/docs/metrics-llm-evals), so alike `GEval`, the `ArenaGEval` metric is a two-step algorithm that first generates a series of `evaluation_steps` using chain of thoughts (CoTs) based on the given `criteria`, before using the generated `evaluation_steps` to determine the winner based on the `evaluation_params` presented in each `LLMTestCase`.
